# MathSolver

TVET college mathematics solving calculator

We will design the application using Object-Oriented Principles to make it clean, organized, and easily expandable with more math topics in the future.
Core Concepts of the Application
Menu-Driven Interface: The user will choose a topic from a menu (e.g., Quadratic Equations, Differentiation, etc.).
Solver Classes: Each mathematical topic will have its own dedicated class responsible for prompting for input, calculating the solution, and generating the step-by-step explanation.
Interface-Based Design: We'll use a Solver interface to ensure that all our math modules have a consistent structure.
Step-by-Step Output: The main focus will be on generating a clear, human-readable breakdown of the solution.
Step 1: Project Structure
Let's create the following files for our project:
TvetMathSolverApp.java: The main entry point of our application. It will display the menu and run the main loop.
Solver.java: An interface that defines the contract for all our solver classes.
UserInput.java: A helper class to handle user input robustly.
solvers/QuadraticEquationSolver.java: A class to solve quadratic equations.
solvers/DifferentiationSolver.java: A class for basic polynomial differentiation.
solvers/CircleAreaSolver.java: A simple class to calculate the area of a circle to demonstrate the structure.
